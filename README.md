This is a Telegram bot to congratulate people`s birthday. 
"telebot" is the library used to import and run for the system.

Once you clone the git and start running it, make sure to get a Telegram BOT Token from the Telegram`s BotFather. 

My project activate the connection with the Telegram API and run through a /start bottom

After the user click "/start", it starts running and request to use a "/bday and a name of the person" to complete its task. Once the inputs are used, it feedbacks with a congratulation text and use the inputed name for the person, who celebrates its birthday. Default system doesnt print out a picture in the bot respond of congratulation, but you can give the path of the picture from your computer and it willoutput a picture of anything you have given the path as well (For example person`s picture, a cake picture, etc.)

If a Birthday person name is not provided, the application will request to try again, and show the example of " >> /bday Alex << " to provide a better insight how to use the bot in correct order.

Thank you and I wish you will enjoy the bot.
